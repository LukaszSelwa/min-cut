### TODO:
- [x] Change tree class to store children and parent
- [x] Finding centroid decomposition
- [x] Finding cross-interested and down-interested paths
- [x] heavy light decomposition
- [x] finding pairs of paths interested in each other
- [x] for each pair of interested paths P,Q finding list of edges interested another path
- [x] algorithm for finding minimum cut for every interesting path
    - [x] implement smawk algorithm 
    - [x] implement algorithm for partial monge matrix
    - [x] use algorithms for finding minimum in monge arrays in project
- [x] implement Karger's simpler algorithm 
- [ ] fix `makefile`
- [ ] compile algorithms for benchmarking
