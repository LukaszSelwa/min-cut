# min-cut
## TODO:
- [x] Change tree class to store children and parent
- [x] Finding centroid decomposition
- [x] Finding cross-interested and down-interested paths
- [x] heavy light decomposition
- [x] finding pairs of paths interested in each other
- [x] for each pair of interested paths P,Q finding list of edges interested another path
- [ ] algorithm for finding minimum cut for every interesting path
    - [x] implement smawk algorithm 
    - [ ] implement algorithm for partial monge matrix
    - [ ] use algorithms for finding minimum in monge arrays in project
